## Vision Statement
When the five of us traveled to Japan on a summer study abroad trip, one of the first things we noticed was the astounding lack of trash cans in public places. We were constantly accumulating trash as we wandered around different stalls and stores, and we resorted to stuffing trash in our pockets for hours before finding the proper place to dispose of it. Upon further research we learned that Japan had reduced the amount of public trash cans after a series of terrorist attacks where terrorists used trash cans to hide explosives. Although we were not the kind of people to litter, we began to wonder about other tourists who would not be so hesitant, and proceed to litter Japan's beatiful environment with garbage. With these thoughts in our mind we decided to create **Rubbish Radar**, our solution to prevent littering and help tourists who were unable to find trash cans.

## What is Rubbish Radar
Rubbish Radar is a web-application that provides the user with a map interface which shows their location and the locations of trash cans that other users have added to the map.

Users can then click on these markers to see the exact location coordinates, as well as a description of the trash can's location. Users can also add trash cans themselves, choosing to either add their current location, or entering specific coordinates themselves. They can find the coordinates when they click on a specific place on the map.

Users can also create an account through either google or by entering an username and password which allows them to upvote and downvote trash can pins. We implemented this feature so that when users see a trash can with innacurate information they can downvote it and when they see an accurate trash can they can upvote it, adding some amount of accountability and control over the trash cans.

## Market Viability
There are a few competitors in the market but they have all been abandoned, meaning there is no real competition for Rubbish Radar in the market.

When measuring our metrics we would be looking mainly at the density of trash cans in a certain radius as well as what the user is doing when logging onto our site. When looking at trash can density we would be able to see where we have the most user input in terms of location, and we can use this for advertising purposes, and to help tailor our service to that location or users in the area. We would use the information about user behavior to see what features of our product are being used more often so we can focus our development cycles on improving more used features.
