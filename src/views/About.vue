      <h2> Our Story</h2>
      <p> 
        At Rubbish Radar, we believe in a world where waste has its rightful place. 
        Born out of frustration from not being able to find a nearby trash 
        can while on-the-go, we decided that no one should have to hold onto 
        their trash any longer than necessary. From this pain point, Rubbish Radar emerged  
        an innovative platform that maps trash can locations from user-generated input, 
        bridging the gap between waste and its final destination. 
      </p>

      <h2> What We Do </h2>
      <p> 
        We provide an easy-to-use, comprehensive web application that allows users
        to submit and locate trash can locations. With every user's contribution, 
        our network of trash can locations grows, making our cities and natural 
        spaces cleaner and more enjoyable for all.
      </p>

      <h2> Our Mission </h2>
      <p> 
        To create a global community-driven platform where every disposed of item
        finds its way to a garbage disposal promoting easy accessibility to our users.
        Through strategic placement of our thoughtfully designed trash cans, we are actively
        taking steps to reduce litter and promote responsible waste disposal. Every trash can 
        we locate serves as a reminder of our dedication to safeguarding the environment for 
        current and future generations. By encouraging proper waste management, we believe that 
        even the smallest actions can create a significant and positive impact on the planet we all call home.
      </p>

          As someone who loves to travel, I would like to have an app that allows me to locate public services such as trash 
          can to avoid carrying trash around with me all day. As a CS major at University of California, Riverside, I wanted 
          to challenge myself to find a solution that helps us find trash cans and hopefully makes the streets look cleaner.

          I'm familiar with the NextJS framework and I enjoy hiking. I don't like to park in places where people leave their carts out. 
          Nor do I like seeing trash on trails when I go out hiking.

          I am a Computer Science major at the University of California, San Diego. On this web application, 
          I have worked on bringing the map implementation by working with the Google Maps API. As a frequent traveler, 
          I strongly believe and see the value in Rubbish Radar as I have found myself looking for garbage disposal 
          in so many places and always looking and scanning for a trash can.

          I'm a Data Science major at UCR, so this project was a step outside of my comfort zone because 
          I was working with frontend development. I worked with the setup of the firebase database and 
          creating a way for users to input their own trash can locations onto the map. This project really 
          resonated with me because I am a frequent traveler and I enjoy going to national parks, and finding 
          trash cans can be a struggle when going to new places.
